Kula Lodge Restaurant Application

This app is being built for the organization of the Kula Lodge restaurant for management and other employees to use and make their work life easier by having everything that is in the office in one app that can be accessed from anywhere.

It will have a login and sign up feature that will distinguish between managers and other staff.
    Managers will have access to updating, editing, deleting certain data as other staff will have a read-only option.

The first feature will be for inventory and ordering made easy with a search field to quickly find an inventory item that is used in the restaurant and will tell you where we order it from, how much we are supposed to have on hand at all times, unit amounts, and a field to order a certain number of cases or pieces. The items that will be ordered will then be mapped out in an easy to read list to quickly put in the order for delivery of the items.
